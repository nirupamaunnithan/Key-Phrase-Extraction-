In the project the objective is to  identify key phrases form the scientific publications. and then do a comparative study on the performance of different machine learning and deep learning algorithms on key phrase classification from scientific publications.  

In this project we identify the key phrases and classify them to TASK, PROCESS or MATERIAL

About dataset: The corpus for this task is built from ScienceDirect open access publications. It consist of 500 journal articles in domains of Computer Science, Physics and Material Sciences. 
Each research article comes in 3 extension files namely .txt (text file) that contains sample paragraphs, .ann (annotation files) documents that contains the annotations of sample paragraphs and .xml (xml files) that contain original full article text.

 Preprocessing includes tokenization, Parts Of Speech Tagging(POS Tagging) identificationn chunking and Named Enity Reognition (NER)

Models such as
- Support Vector Machines
- Support Vector Machines with Sampling
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)
- Multi-head Attention Model

are being done for classification# Key-Phrase-Extraction-
